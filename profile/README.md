# 🌑 NyxStack

High-performance, zero-dependency Go libraries engineered for developers who want clean APIs, strong typing, and production-ready tooling without the bloat. NyxStack packages are built to be fast, predictable, and composable—small pieces that click together into powerful systems.


## 🔧 What We Build

**Focused, minimal, rock-solid Go modules:**

- **cli** — Fluent CLI framework with automatic flag inheritance, type-safe args, lifecycle hooks, and full shell completion.  
- **dotenv** — Strict, standards-accurate dotenv parser with expansion, escapes, struct unmarshalling, and typed env access.  
- **schema** — Type-safe validation with JSON Schema export, unions, conditionals, i18n messages, and rich error APIs.  
- **signals** — Clean, channel-based OS signal handling for graceful shutdowns.  
- **openapi** — Programmatic OpenAPI 3.1 spec builder with reusable components and full generation.  
- **color** — Zero-dependency ANSI color/styling for expressive terminal output.  
- **scalarui** — Serve Scalar API Reference UI directly from Go with full customization.  
- **i18n** — Zero-dependency internationalization system with extraction and pluralization.
- **router** — HTTP router with first-class OpenAPI + documentation generation.  
- **di** — Lightweight dependency-injection container for clean module wiring.  
- **controller** — Fluent API/controller layer using Go structs + tags for a full backend framework.  
- **orm** — Type-safe, high-performance ORM with automatic migrations and tooling.  
- **nyx** — The CLI for bootstrapping and managing NyxStack-based backend services.

## 🧩 Design Principles

**Zero dependencies.**  
Every package stays lean and audit-friendly.

**Fluent APIs.**  
Readable, chainable, and ergonomic with strong types.

**Predictable execution.**  
Deterministic behavior and clear guarantees.

**Composability first.**  
Each module stands alone or plugs cleanly into others.


## 🚀 The Mission

Build a unified toolbox for Go developers: fast, elegant, practical.  
No frameworks masquerading as ecosystems—just sharp tools that do one job exceptionally well.

More libraries are in development. NyxStack will continue expanding into configuration, testing, APIs, data modeling, and more.
